# Automatic Voucher priting

During examinations there are a lot of students are approaching account windows for fee vouchers. Created a system in which computers with RFID card readers are placed into various sections

 First we download the report from ERP and save it on google sheets (_which has integrated API that returns a JSON object_). That sheet is read by the application and every time the student scans his card if it has any pending voucher then it will automatically be printed.

## Just punch the card and have the voucher
